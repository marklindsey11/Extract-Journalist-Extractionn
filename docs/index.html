        <h1>StoryWeb: turn stories into research data</h1>

        <p>
            StoryWeb will extract structured actor networks from journalistic
            texts and analyze them. Essential relationships between the people
            and organizations mentioned usable as a knowledge graph. In this
            way, complex stories turn into structured datasets for future
            research.
        </p>

        <h2>Why do this?</h2>
        <p>
            Investigative journalism is often about networks of actors: Which
            companies, institutions and politicians are connected to each other,
            which mafia structures operate across national borders or which cliques
            and family structures control the allocation of posts. The article
            as a form of presentation is a hurdle: In order to remain readable,
            stories often omit essential background and references to other texts
            and stories.
        </p>
        <p>
            We want to <strong>improve knowledge management in journalism</strong>. While the general
            public is an important consumer of media reporting, there are also many
            groups that consume news for professional reasons, e.g. business analysts,
            researchers  and other journalists. They read the texts primarily to
            understand connections that have already been uncovered.
        </p>
        <p>
            StoryWeb will systematically structure research knowledge and find
            connections between different stories and the work of different journalists.
            Important stories and relationships associared with a character
            will be summarized. This can be used both to an initial overview of a set
            of stories, but also for in-depth analysis of individuals and organizations.
            Information from relevant, structured data sources like
            <a href="https://www.opensanctions.org">OpenSanctions</a> will be linked up
            to provide additional details for specialists.
        </p>
    
        <h2>How will this work?</h2>
        <p>
            In a first step, we want to build partnerships with a small selection of
            relevant, investigative media whose reporting is most suitable for
            extracting story graphs.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll download articles from such media sites, extract article text and
            metadata, and annotate relevant person and company names through various
            named entity extractors.
        </p>
        <p>
            The entities mentioned should be disambiguated and merged between stories.
            Through simple analyses, the text should also provide clues
            as to the nature of the relationships among the identified actors. These
            relationships are finally classified into a category system through manual
            feedback. Automated classification can be developed as we collect a corpus
            of training data.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of the project, a small number of example story graphs will be built,
            each focussed on an economic or political scandal in recent history.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also want to explore uploading some of the resulting relationship
            information to Wikidata.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
        <p>
            The project generates research material that can be integrated into
            the reasearch workflows of various user groups:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Journalists</strong> who receive a systematic picture of
            the work of their colleagues and will more easily find connections
            between previously separate stories.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Businesses</strong> also want to understand the activities
            of a particular company or person in depth, and keep an eye on whether
            there is negative media coverage regarding one of their customers.
        </p>
