        <h2>What societal challenge does your prototype address?</h2>
        <p>
            The project aims to improve knowledge management in journalism. Because in
            addition to interested citizens, there are also many groups that consume
            news for professional reasons, e.g. researchers from business and science
            and other journalists. They read the texts primarily to understand
            connections that have already been uncovered.
        </p>
        <p>
            Investigative journalism is often about networks of actors: Which
            companies, associations and politicians are connected to each other, which
            mafia structures operate across national borders or which cliques and family
            structures are involved influence the allocation of posts. The article as a
            form of presentation is a hurdle: In order to remain readable (and to minimize
            the link to the competition), the journalist often has to omit the
            background story and references to other texts and stories.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project therefore opens up a different approach. The most important
            connections of an actor to other characters and events should be summarized
            at a glance in order to facilitate both the introduction and the in-depth
            analysis of individual connections. Information from relevant, structured
            data sources can also be integrated and provide additional details for
            specialists.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project wants to extract structured actor networks from journalistic
            texts and analyze them. It is intended to make essential relationships
            between the people and organizations mentioned usable as quantitative
            data. In this way, complex stories can be connected as data sets for
            future research.
        </p>
        <p>
            StoryWeb will systematically structure research knowledge and find
            connections between different stories and the work of different journalists
            and media houses.
        </p>
        <h2>How do you tackle the problem?</h2>
        <p>
            First of all, individual media offers should be specifically selected whose
            reporting is suitable for the extraction of actor networks.
        </p>
        <p>
            The implementation is to take place as a Python program that downloads
            articles from media sites, then extracts the article text and metadata, and
            identifies relevant names through various named entity extractors.
        </p>
        <p>
            The actors mentioned should be disambiguated on the basis of joint naming
            with others. Through simple analyses, the text should also provide clues
            as to the nature of the relationships among the identified actors. These
            relationships are finally classified into a category system through manual
            feedback. An automated classification should be trained in this way.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of the project, exemplary networks of actors are to be extracted
            for suitable research complexes, cleaned up and then published on an
            interactive website with detailed naming of sources.
        </p>
        <p>
            It should be tested to enter relationships between actors with existing
            Wikidata items including source information in the Wikidata database.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Who is your tool aimed at?</h2>
        <p>
            The project generates research material and presents it on an interactive
            website that can be integrated into the workflows of various user groups.
        </p>
        <p>
            Journalists who receive a systematic picture of the work of their
            colleagues and other media and can therefore start research faster or
            find connections between previously separate stories. I have access to
            a professional network of journalists who can use the tool and
            provide feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are also service providers, for example in the areas of finance,
            law, real estate or the art trade, who want to know whether there is
            negative media coverage of one of their customers.
